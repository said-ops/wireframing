# Wireframing

Wireframing is a way to design software at a structural level. It involves outlining the basic structure and layout without detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. A wireframe is used in early development stages to establish layout and functionality, focusing on user needs and journeys.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- Translates abstract ideas into tangible presentations for stakeholders.
- Quicker and cheaper to review compared to high-fidelity designs.
- Identifies potential usability issues early by focusing on interface structure.
- Acts as a guide for design and development phases to align with the initial vision.
- Helps ensure a product is intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Elements Found in a Wireframe
- **Layout Structure**: Defines how elements are arranged on a page (e.g., header, content, footer).
- **Navigation**: Details how users move through the application using links or menus.
- **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and actions (e.g., buttons) will be placed.
- **Functionality**: Outlines key interactions and features.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Simple sketches focusing on structure and functionality.
- Use placeholders and lack design details.
- Ideal for early-stage brainstorming and quick iteration.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- Detailed, polished representations resembling the final product.
- Include layout, typography, color schemes, and sometimes interactivity.
- Serve as a reference for developers during implementation.

> **Note**: This project uses a high-fidelity wireframe with specific layouts and typographic details.
